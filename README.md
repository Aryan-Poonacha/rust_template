## Tool Usage And Documentation

### Pattern Generator

This is a command-line tool written in Rust that generates cool and interesting patterns. It currently supports two types of patterns: squares and triangles.

#### Installation
Before you can use this tool, you need to install Rust. You can do this by following the instructions on the official Rust website.

Once you have Rust installed, you can build and install the pattern generator tool by cloning this repository and running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
cargo build --release
```

This will create an optimized executable in the target/release directory.

Usage
You can run the pattern generator tool using the cargo run command followed by the pattern type and size. For example, to generate a square pattern of size 5, you would use:

```
cargo run square 5
```

And to generate a triangle pattern of size 7, you would use:

```
cargo run triangle 7
```

The pattern type can be either square or triangle, and the size must be a positive integer.

Please replace cargo run with the actual command to run your Rust application if itâ€™s different.

The CI/CD included in the deploy.yml file should automatically build and run an example of this.
